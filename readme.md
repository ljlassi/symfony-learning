Trying to learn to use Symfony properly. Using concepts like routing with annotations, ORM, Twig template engine and unit and response testing.

My aim for developing this application is to learn the best practices with Symfony, so that I can start my planned large project with Symfony.

Currently the application can add and list products, which are saved to a MySQL database using ORM.

All code (including mine) is licensed with the MIT license. Feel free to do whatever you want with this.
